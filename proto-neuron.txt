# base data for sim-sharing:
	brain
	neuron range to be processed

- control device:
	init sharing
	generate brain
	make connections
	listen for peers to connect

	divide the neurons wrt number of peers connected to control device
	
- balance load:
	halt the sim if insufficient peers are connected
	re-calculate neuron ranges if new peer is connected

- threading:
	main: keep track of neurons
	load-balancer: re-calculation of ranges
	network: keep track of remote peers and process data to be used over the connections

network struct:
	peers  [Array] remote peers
	ranges [Array] nneuron id ranges for respective peers

	In-stream:
		new peer connection data
		neuron firings

	Out-stream:
		neuron data
		brain data
